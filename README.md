# Altschool-Third-Semester-Exam
This repository contains the configuration files for the deployment of a webapp and a microservices app.
Both the webapp and the microservices Socks app were deployed using kubernetes. Terraform was used for the provisioning of the infrastructure.
I used ansible as the configuration management tool.
I further implemented a CI/CD pipeline using jenkins. The apps were hosted on https://www.osujizubis.me
